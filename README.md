Hello to everyone and welcome to my first project on GitHub!

This C# project provides an easy login and displays quotations I like. I made the project to take my first step for starting my second career in software development.

The app has a simple data connection, i.e. the quotations are taken from the file "Texte.html", contained in the folder "DatenAnbindungEinfach". Please note: This file must be copied into the start folder, whre the app itself is located.   

Because all content is in German (and it was easier for me working in German language first ;-) ), the project and the commit statements are held in German. You can easily replace the quotations by others, in English or other languages. If you need help, feel free to contact me.

Happy coding!
Gregor
